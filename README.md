This is my personal portfolio, built from scratch as an interactive experience inspired by the hacker terminals, CRT monitors, and sci-fi aesthetics of the late 90s and early 2000s.

## 🚀 About This Project

As a backend-focused developer, I wanted to create a portfolio that was not only a place to showcase my work but a project in itself. This website is my take on a frontend application, built with a heavy emphasis on a unique, immersive, and nostalgic user experience.

Instead of a traditional, minimalist design, I opted for a retro terminal theme that reflects my passion for classic sci-fi, old-school gaming, and the early, creative era of the web. The entire site is designed to feel like you're interacting with a computer from a bygone era, but it's built on a modern, high-performance tech stack.

## ✨ Key Features

* **👾 Immersive Terminal Aesthetic:** A cohesive design with a "Matrix-style" digital rain background, CRT scanline effects, and a monospace font scheme.
* **🎬 Animated "Typing" Hero Section:** An engaging introduction that simulates text being typed out in a terminal, powered by `react-type-animation`.
* **🌧️ Custom "Digital Rain" Background:** A from-scratch, performant background animation built using the **HTML Canvas API** and React hooks, avoiding external libraries for the core effect.
* **💼 Responsive Project Showcase:** Project cards are displayed in a fluid grid that automatically adapts to any screen size, from mobile to desktop.
* **▶️ Animated Video Modals:** A reusable React component that displays project demo videos in a modal with a custom CRT "monitor on/off" animation built with CSS `@keyframes`.
* **🔗 Stylized ASCII-inspired Links:** Contact links are framed with "glitching" ASCII-style brackets to maintain the terminal theme.
* **📄 Direct CV Download:** A clear call-to-action for recruiters to easily download my resume.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Every component, from the hero section to the project grid, is designed to be fully functional and visually appealing on mobile devices.
